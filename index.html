        <h1>Tracking the Evolution of Geofeeds: Data Validation and Adoption</h1>
        <h3>Project Vision</h3>
        <p>This research explores Geofeeds' validation, adoption, and development patterns as a future potential
            for the improvement of IP geolocation. Geofeeds are independently published lists of IP address ranges linked
            with geographic data, enabling the possibility for more accurate location data than using traditional methods.
            Geofeeds have the ability to improve the accuracy of IP geolocation, which is important for such purposes as
            online security, content delivery, and targeted services. But as great as this potential is, they're still new
            and not widely adopted or fully understood.</p>
        <p>We started by verifying the Geofeed data through an automated process that begins with checking for duplicate entries
            to eliminate redundancy early on. Using the geofeed-validator tool, we then identified standard violations and 
            formatting errors. After examining hundreds of thousands of entries, we found common issues such as incorrect IP 
            prefixes and subdivision codes. We also quantified the frequency of these problems and identified the network organizations 
            responsible. This gave us a clear picture of the most frequent errors and highlighted key areas for improving data quality.</p>
        <p>The project's second section examined adoption. To determine how popular Geofeeds are, we mapped Geofeed entries to 
            their corresponding Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) using daily data snapshots from CAIDA. We kept track of how many 
            ASes took part, how many IP ranges were covered, and how Geofeed coverage and errors changed over time. Between 
            August 2024 and April 2025, we saw significant growth, especially in the deployment of IPv6, but we also noticed that 
            most ASes still only published a small amount of Geofeed data.</p>
        <p>This project is unique because it emphasizes automation to support continuous analysis. Prior research did not delve 
            into error types but instead examined snapshots taken every few weeks. In addition to closing that gap, our work 
            offers tools that researchers and network operators can use to more consistently track Geofeed adoption and data quality. 
            Our method is more automated, more thorough, and more appropriate for long-term monitoring than previous studies. This 
            project establishes the foundation for future IP geolocation that is more transparent and dependable by enhancing the way 
            we validate and analyze Geofeeds.</p>
